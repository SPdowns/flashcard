            <p>JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, just-in-time compiled, multi-paradigm programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.</span>

        <h2>Operators</h2>
          <div>
            <p>An operator is a special character (or characters) that indicates an action to be performed. +, -, *, /, and % are operators. </p>

        <h2>Variables</h2>
          <div>
            <p>Variables can be thought of as containers used to store information. They allow for a way to label data with a descriptive name. </p>

        <h2>Variable naming convention</h2>
          <div>
            <p>In JavaScript, it's conventional to give variables names that start with a lowercase letter, and if they are more than one word, to capitalize the first letter of subsequent words. This is called lower camel case, because the capitalized letters look like a camel's humps... or something. </p>
